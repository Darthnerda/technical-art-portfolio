Welcome to my technical art portfolio! On the sidebar you can navigate to a few of the pieces I've worked on. Most of the work in this portfolio comes from my time working with multimedia artists on interactive installations. A few pieces are relatively recent, such as [FX and Pipeline TA](/fx-and-pipeline-ta), [Perfect Photograph System](/perfect-photograph-system) and [Realtime Slime Traversal and Trail](/realtime-slime-traversal-and-trail).

What you will **not** find here is my pipeline TA work for Retina Imageworks and Echobend, my volumetric video work for Aina Tech, Meta Resemble, and Pixel Light Effects, or my work on narrative systems for indie game Qareen.
