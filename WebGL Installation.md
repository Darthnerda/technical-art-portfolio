Vibrant Eyes and Dark Machines was an interactive 3D installation I created using the THREE.js WebGL framework. This was my very first foray into 3D graphics coding way back in 2017, and at the time I was interested in building dynamic animations, and in this piece I created a relatively simple hierarchy of rotating objects.

Users could move around in the space and click on the orbs, causing them to expand into photographs I had taken under the theme of "dreams", and spoken word poems played related to themes of anthropocene extinctions and childhood cyberculture.
